Transform your renovation dreams into reality with our expert contractors. Enjoy a seamless process from start to finish with our curated professionals who provide guidance and support tailored to your needs.

## Our Process

### Your Renovation Journey, Simplified

With Renotive, you can easily define your project thoroughly, select the materials you want, be educated about your project, and then connect with highly vetted contractors to compare their bids on your project.

**Step 1: Share Your Vision**

Tell us about the renovation you’re planning using our project questionnaire. We’ll ask for your project scope, timeline, and budget. This helps us curate the perfect contractor list. Renotive’s online tools help you clarify your project scope and align it with your budget.

**Step 2: Get Your Personalized Shortlist of General Contractors**

After sharing your project details, you’ll receive a shortlist of Renotive-vetted general contractors, matched to you based on your unique project criteria. Our team has diligently pre-screened every contractor in our network for you.

**Step 3: Choose Contractors to Connect With**

Evaluate your matched contractors’ profiles, portfolios, and customer reviews. Choose the ones you’d like to bid on your project. If you don’t see what you’re looking for, you can decline your matches and request new ones from a Renotive matchmaker.

**Step 4: Host Your Site Visits**

Set up a separate meeting with each contractor to review your project goals on-site. They’ll then prepare an estimate, or “bid.” Some contractors prefer to start with a quick call. Use Renotive’s tools for communicating, or to host virtual site visits by video with your contractors.

**Step 5: Compare Your Estimates**

When you’ve received your bids, it’s decision time. Review each estimate for the total cost, and for what’s included or excluded. Contractors prepare estimates differently. Take advantage of a free bid-leveling call with a Renotive renovation advisor. Their expertise can help you make the most informed choice.

**Step 6: Award Your Project**

Agree on a contract with your chosen contractor. Make it official by uploading your signed contract and paying your contractor’s deposit.

**Step 7: Renovate Fearlessly**

Here’s where the magic happens! Your contractor will keep you informed throughout the construction process. Renotive’s team is dedicated to your renovation’s success. We’re always here and happy to offer guidance if you need it.

**Step 8: Review Your Contractor**

Once you’ve checked off every item on your construction punch list, celebrate this amazing moment! Then, help out future renovators by completing your review on Renotive. Let us know if you’d like us to consider featuring your project on our blog. We provide free professional photography for accepted projects.
